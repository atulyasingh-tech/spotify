# TRACKS.md

The library for this session. Six tracks. Titles, artists, and durations below.

Audio sources use the SoundHelix sample MP3s (the doc's offline fallback): they
stream cross-origin reliably, so `index.html` plays out of the box even without
local files. To go fully offline, drop `track-01.mp3` … `track-06.mp3` into
`./assets/audio/` and swap the `src` values in the hardcoded array to the local
paths. Cover art lives at `./assets/covers/`; if a cover file is missing the app
falls back to a generated gradient, so nothing breaks visually.

Durations are the SoundHelix clip lengths; the player shows the true length once
audio metadata loads, so the table is only a hint for the spec.
