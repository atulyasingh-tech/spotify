# Project Rules & Hard Constraints

## Core Technical Rules
- **Product**: Spotify web application clone.
- **Single File Architecture**: Everything MUST be in a single 
`index.html` file (all inline CSS in `<style>` tags and all Vanilla JavaScript in `<script>` tags).
- **No Frameworks / Dependencies**: Strictly no external frameworks, libraries, npm packages, build tools, or CDN scripts.
- **Execution Context**: Designed to run via a local live server (e.g., Antigravity preview), NOT by double-clicking standard file URLs.
- **Data Source**: Track data is hardcoded based on `TRACKS.md`.
- **State Management**: Application state and persistence must be handled via `localStorage`.
- **Specifications Directory**: All specification documents belong in the `spec/` folder.
